# notebook

An ultra-simple browser based text app using localstorage. Create, edit & delete multiple text notes, limited only by your browsers localStorage capacity.

The successor, but not a replacement, of [TextPad](https://github.com/syndicatefx/textpad)

## Usage

- Type yout note title in the input field and press ENTER
- Click on the note title to access the note content to edit anytime
- Click the `x` following the note title to delete that note, you will be prompted to confirm deletion
- When writing/editing a note you have a char counter and a DOWNLOAD NOTE button on the bottom right corner of the screen

Everything is stored on your browser's localStorage, you can access your notes using the browser and URL you first used to store them. Using another browser or device even if the URL is the same, will start another localStorage session for that specific browser/device.

Make sure to download all your notes if you intend on clearing your browsers storage, or if you are re-installing your browser for some reason.

I built this tool for my personal usage, it does the the job of keeping text i write or copy/paste into it for future reference while browsing online. It is not meant to be a full blown texteditor or document creator with thousands of features and settings. Enjoy!
